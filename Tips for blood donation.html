<h3 style="color:red;">Before Donation</h3><br>

<ul>
<li>In the days before your donation, eat healthy, iron-rich foods such as spinach, red meat, fish, poultry, beans, iron-fortified cereals and raisins. This will help maintain a healthy iron level. The number one reason for deferrals is anemia. &nbsp;</li>

<li>Get a good night’s sleep. Drink an extra 16 oz. of water and fluids before the donation; you can be deferred for dehydration. &nbsp;</li>

<li>At least 3 hours before donating, eat a balanced meal and avoid fatty foods, such as hamburgers, fries, or ice cream.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3 style="color:red;">During Donation</h3><br>

<ul>
<li>Wear clothing with short sleeves or sleeves that can be raised above the elbow. </li>

<li>If you have a preference of arm or vein that you like the phlebotomist to use for your donation, let them know. &nbsp;</li>

<li>Relax, listen to music, talk to others, or watch movies on our comfortable donor lounge chairs designed specifically for apheresis donations.</li>

<li>Enjoy an assortment of refreshments in our canteen area immediately after donating.</li>
</ul>

 <br>                                   
<h3 style="color:red;"> After Donation</h3><br>

<ul>
<li>Drink plenty of fluids over the next 24-48 hours to replenish any fluids you lost during donation.</li>

<li>Avoid strenuous physical exertion, heavy lifting or
pulling with the donation arm for about five hours.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Eat well balanced meals for the next 24 hours.</li>

<li>Smoking and alcohol consumption is not
recommended.</li>
</ul><br>
